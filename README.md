What's in the app:

Simple HTTP server (localhost port 3001 only - no external connections)
Basic Electron interface with Tabletop Audio branding
No data collection, tracking, or analytics
No internet access required except initial download
Source code available on request

Security details:

App only communicates locally between Stream Deck and your browser
No passwords, personal data, or sensitive information stored
Runs entirely on your computer - nothing sent to external servers
Can be completely uninstalled through normal Windows/macOS methods

Why it's unsigned:

Code signing certificates are expensive for an app that not a lot of people will use!
This is alpha testing software - full signing MIGHT come with official release

TL;DR

"This is a simple local companion app that helps your Stream Deck control Tabletop Audio's Custom SoundPad. It's essentially a small web server that runs only on your computer."
